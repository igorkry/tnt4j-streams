/**
 * A linear-time algorithm for computing a topological sort of a directed acyclic graph. A topological sort is an
 * ordering of the nodes in a graph such that for each node v, all of the ancestors of v appear in the ordering before v
 * itself. Topological sorting is useful, for example, when computing some function on a DAG where each node's value
 * depends on its ancestors. Running a topological sort and then visiting the nodes in the order specified by this
 * sorted order ensures that the necessary values for each node are available before the node is visited.
 * <p>
 * There are several algorithms for computing topological sorts. The one used here was first described in "Edge-Disjoint
 * Spanning Trees and Depth-First Search" by Robert Tarjan. The algorithm is reminiscent of Kosaraju's SCC algorithm. We
 * begin by constructing the reverse graph G^{rev} from the source graph, then running a depth-first search from each
 * node in the graph. Whenever we finish expanding a node, we add it to a list of visited nodes. The intuition behind
 * this algorithm is that a DFS in the reverse graph will visit every node that is an ancestor of the given node before
 * it finishes expanding out any node. Since those nodes will be added to the sorted order before the expanded node, we
 * have the desired property of the topological sort.
 * <p>
 * This process can be augmented to detect a cycle in the original graph. As we do the search, we'll maintain a set of
 * nodes that we have visited and a set of nodes that we have expanded. If when doing the DFS we find a node that has
 * been visited but not expanded, it means that we have encountered a cycle in the graph. Moreover, if a cycle exists,
 * we know that this will occur, since the first time any node in the cycle is visited the DFS will expand out the
 * cycle.
